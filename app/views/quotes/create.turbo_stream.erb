<%# app/views/quotes/create.turbo_stream.erb %>

<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", @quote %>
<%= turbo_stream.update Quote.new, "" %>
<%= render_turbo_stream_flash_messages %>

<!-- alternatively this file could be written as:

<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes" do %>
  <%= render partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>
<% end %>

This is in block form, and the following expressions are equivalent in rails:

render partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote }
render @quote
